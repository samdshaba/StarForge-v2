StarForge: A C++ Space Survival Game
StarForge is an enhanced console-based 2D survival game written in C++. Explore a dynamic map, collect resources, craft items, dodge enemy drones, and survive meteor showers. This project demonstrates advanced C++ concepts like file I/O, object-oriented design, and game loop optimization, making it a great learning tool and a fun game!
Features

Dynamic Map: Navigate a 12x12 grid to collect Ore ('O'), Energy ('E'), and Scrap ('S').
Crafting System: Craft Shields (2 Ore, 1 Energy) or Repair Kits (1 Ore, 1 Scrap) to survive.
Enemies: Avoid or outsmart roaming drones that chase you and deal damage.
Score System: Earn points by collecting resources and surviving longer.
Save/Load: Persist your game state to a file to continue your adventure later.
Random Events: Survive meteor showers that spawn hazardous obstacles.
Simple Controls: Use WASD to move, 'c' to craft, 'r' to use Repair Kit, 's' to save, 'q' to quit.

How to Play

Clone the repository: git clone <your-repo-url>
Compile the game: g++ StarForge.cpp -o StarForge
Run the game: ./StarForge (Linux/Mac) or StarForge.exe (Windows)
Move with WASD, collect resources, and avoid Drones ('D') and Hazards ('X').
Craft items with 'c' and use Repair Kits with 'r' to restore health.
Save your progress with 's' and load it on startup.
Survive as long as possible to maximize your score!
